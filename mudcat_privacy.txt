Data Privacy Statement for Mudcat Browser Tools
-----------------------------------------------

This addon extracts from mudcat pages:

1 The typed-in guest name of the latest post if posting as a guest. This is used to pre-fill the name next time. It does not extract the name of signed-in users.
2 The thread number of posts viewed, and the latest post number in each. This is to highlight new posts and scroll to them.
3 The text of the latest post. This is so that the text can be recovered with the 'Recover text' button. 

This data is stored within the browser. No data is sent anywhere or shared with any other system.
